# Pong

This project entails the development of a classic Pong Game using Assembly Language specifically designed for the x86 architecture. Leveraging Interrupts for displaying pixels on-screen, obtaining system time, and reading keypresses, the project successfully implemented the dynamic motion of the ball and two-player paddles within the game environment. Additionally, an innovative feature incorporated a Computer AI player equipped with a straightforward mathematical algorithm to engage in gameplay, providing a competitive challenge for players. This endeavor not only showcases the game's core functionalities but also demonstrates the integration of low-level programming techniques in creating a fully functional and entertaining Pong Game within an Assembly Language framework.
